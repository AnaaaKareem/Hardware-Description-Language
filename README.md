# Using HDL with nand2tetris software

This README provides instructions on how to use HDL (Hardware Description Language) with the nand2tetris software. The nand2tetris software allows importing of .hdl files for the script, .tst files to input values, and .cmp files to compare the output.

## Prerequisites
Before using the nand2tetris software with HDL, you need to have the following:
- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 7 or later installed on your computer
- nand2tetris software downloaded and installed on your computer. You can download the software from [nand2tetris.org/software](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software)

## Installation
The nand2tetris software does not require installation. You can simply download and extract the software to a directory of your choice. 

## Usage
1. Open the nand2tetris software and navigate to the HDL folder.
2. Create or import an HDL file. An HDL file contains a description of a digital circuit.
3. Create or import a .tst file. A .tst file contains input values for the digital circuit described in the HDL file.
4. Run the HDL file with the input values in the .tst file using the nand2tetris software.
5. The output of the digital circuit will be displayed in the console.
6. Compare the output with the expected output in the .cmp file.

## Karnaugh Maps and Logic Gates
The tables provided in this README can be used to create Karnaugh maps and logic gates for the corresponding digital circuits described in the HDL files. Karnaugh maps are used to simplify Boolean algebra expressions and create optimized logic gates for a digital circuit.
